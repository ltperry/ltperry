- 👋 Hi, I’m @ltperry
- 👀 I’m interested in broadening my data wrangling, cleaning and visualization skills. I currently work as a data analyst primarily working with SQL and Tableau.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get around GitHub :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on environmental issues, conservation, climate. I truly enjoy several outdoor activites, namely skiing in the winter and fishing in the summers. Both greatly effected by our rapidly chaning climate. I would love to help illustate challenges and solutions using data!
