- Hi, I’m @ltperry
- I’m interested in broadening my data wrangling, cleaning and visualization skills. I currently work as a data analyst primarily working with SQL and Tableau.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on environmental issues, conservation, climate. I truly enjoy several outdoor activites, namely skiing in the winter, waterfowling in the fall and fishing in the summers. All are greatly effected by our rapidly changing climate. I would love to help illustate challenges and solutions using data!
